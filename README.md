* This is my university assignments all over my studying years feel free to dig & learn 
* Repo only contains small projects, big ones you can find on my github account [escalopa](https://github.com/escalopa)
* I have stopped pushing to this repo starting from my third year since projects have gone bigger and I create a repo for each now.
